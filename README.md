## 📐 Architecture

The project follows a **multi-layered architecture** ensuring separation of concerns:

- **Controller Layer** (`controller/`) → Handles incoming HTTP requests, maps endpoints, and returns responses.  
- **DTO Layer** (`dto/`) → Defines Data Transfer Objects for clean request/response handling.  
- **Entity Layer** (`entity/`) → Contains JPA entities representing database tables.  
- **Service Layer** (`service/`) → Implements business logic, validations, and orchestrates between controllers and repositories.  
- **Repository Layer** (`repository/`) → Interfaces with the database using Spring Data JPA.  
- **Configuration Layer** (`config/`) → Manages application-wide configurations such as security, CORS, and beans.  
- **Utils Layer** (`utils/`) → Provides helper functions like report generation and common utilities.
